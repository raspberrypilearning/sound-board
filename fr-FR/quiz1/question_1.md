Which of these components **do not** have polarity (a positive and negative leg).

--- choices ---

- ( ) A buzzer

  --- feedback ---

Try again, a buzzer does have polarity (usually shown by a '+' above the positive leg). When you wire a buzzer the wrong way round, it will still make a sound, but it might not play as you expected.

- (x) A button

  --- feedback ---

Correct! A button doesn't have any polarity. You can place a button in any direction. The Raspberry Pi Pico will check if the connection is closed or open.

- ( ) A potentiometer

  --- feedback ---

Not quite, a potentiometer has three legs. A positive, a ground, and an analogue signal. These must be connected correctly for your potentiometer to work as expected. If you mix up the positive and ground then the potentiometer will work in reverse.

- ( ) A single-colour LED

  --- feedback ---

Not quite, a single-colour LED has one long leg (positive) and one short leg (ground) and needs to be wired correctly.
