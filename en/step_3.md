## Compose your sounds

<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap">
<div style="flex-basis: 200px; flex-grow: 1; margin-right: 15px;">
</div>
Itâ€™s good practice to build your project up gradually. In this step, you will connect and code your buzzers to create different sounds and test that they are working.

**Define:** a function for your first tune. Think of sensible names for your tune. For example, a function that will play an annoying sound could be called `annoying_sound`.

A <span style="color: #0faeb0">**Chiptune**</span>, or 8-bit music, is a tune created by programming the sound chips of computers to produce certain frequencies of sound rather than using traditional instruments - mostly in retro video games and arcade machines. Even though coding music now uses much more advanced techniques, people still love creating and listening to chiptunes because of their retro feel. You can recreate any piece of music at all using chiptune!

A user can manually stop code that is running using the red stop icon in Thonny. At this point, if a buzzer is making a sound the sound will continue playing - this can be very annoying!

Check your code carefully.
 
You may need to experiment with the notes and timing to get the tune just right.

--- /collapse ---

If you find a bug that is not listed here. Can you work out how to fix it?

We love hearing about your bugs and how you fixed them. Use the **Send feedback** button at the bottom of this page and tell us if you found a different bug in your project.

**Create** and **test** the rest of the tune functions that you would like to create. 

Remember to:
+ Define the function
+ Enter the code to play your tune
+ Call the function
+ Test the function

**Tip:** Remember to comment out `#` or delete the function call of the previous tune so that you only hear the one that you would like to test.
