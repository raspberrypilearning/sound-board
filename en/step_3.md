## Control your sounds

<div style="flex-basis: 200px; flex-grow: 1; margin-right: 15px;">
</div>
Itâ€™s good practice to build your project up gradually. In this step, you will connect and code your buzzers to create different sounds and test that this is working.

Connect your buzzer(s) to the Raspberry Pi Pico:

single-buzzer-wiring
stereo-buzzer-wiring
earphones-wiring

**Tip:** If you have not already prepared your LEDs, and need to remind yourself of how to connect LEDs to resistors and jumper wires, visit our [Introduction to the Pico](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/introduction-to-the-pico){:target="_blank"} guide.

**Tip:** Create and then test functions one at a time.

**Create:** functions for each sound or tune that you want to include in your project. 

Add code within the new functions to play a single note, a tune or make a sound effect:

Play a note and allow other actions to take place while it is playing:

**Tip:** Give your functions names that match the kind of sound they make so you will remember what they do.

--- /task ---

--- task ---

At the end of your code, underneath your mood function definitions, add code to call the function that you want to test. 

**Tip:** Make sure you new code is not indented.

**Test:** Run your code to test that your sounds play as expected.

Update you new code to call your sound functions one at a time testing each one by running your code.

**Debug:** You might find some bugs in your project that you need to fix. Here are some common bugs.

--- collapse ---

---
title: I don't hear anything when I run my sound function

+ Check that the pins in your code match the pins your Speaker is connected to.
+ Check that you have removed the sticker that covers the sound hole in new buzzwea

title: My RGB LED show the wrong colour

Check your code to make sure that your colour values are in the right order. Use the ['RGB Colour guide'](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_rgb.asp){:target="_blank"} to check your code matches the colour you expect.
