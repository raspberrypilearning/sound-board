## Compose your sounds

<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap">
<div style="flex-basis: 200px; flex-grow: 1; margin-right: 15px;">
</div>
Itâ€™s good practice to build your project up gradually. In this step, you will connect and code your buzzers to create different sounds and test that they are working.

Connect your buzzer(s) to the Raspberry Pi Pico:

[[[single-buzzer-wire]]]
stereo-buzzer-wiring
earphones-wiring

Import `Speaker` from the picozero library:

Add code to set the pins for your connected LED(s):

</p>

**Tip:** Create and then test functions one at a time.

**Create:** functions for each sound or tune that you want to include in your project. 

Add code within the new functions to play a single note, a tune or make a sound effect:

Play a note and wait for it to finish:

def c_note(): 
    speaker.play(523, 0.5)

Play a note and allow other actions to take place while it is playing:

**Tip:** Give your functions names that match the kind of sound they make so you will remember what they do.

--- /task ---

--- task ---

At the end of your code, underneath your mood function definitions, add code to call the function that you want to test. 

**Tip:** Make sure you new code is not indented.

**Test:** Run your code to test that your sounds play as expected.

Update you new code to call your sound functions one at a time testing each one by running your code.

**Debug:** You might find some bugs in your project that you need to fix. Here are some common bugs.

--- collapse ---

---
title: I don't hear anything when I run my sound function

+ Check that the pins in your code match the pins your Speaker is connected to.
+ Check that you have removed the sticker that covers the sound hole in new buzzwea
