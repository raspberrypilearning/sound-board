## Introduction

Create a sound machine that will play sound effects or music using buttons, switches or a potentiometer.

<span style="color: #0faeb0">**Sounds**</span> can be helpful, calming, annoying and energising. A newborn baby can find a white noise machine calming and the sound helps them sleep. DJs use portable sound machines to compose beats as they travel. Pranksters use sound effect machines to make people laugh. Can you think of a sound machine that you have used in your day to day life?
</p>

You will:

+ Design a device that uses sound for a specific purpose
+ Program music or sounds effects to play on a buzzer
+ Create an interface that allows user control of sounds

To complete this project you will need:

+ A Raspberry Pi Pico with pin headers soldered on
+ A data USB A to micro USB cable
+ A potentiometer or buttons (bought or crafted)
+ A passive tone buzzer 
+ Jumper wires
+ Craft materials including card, sticky tape and kitchen foil

Optional:

+ RGB LED(s) or single colour LED(s) with resistors and jumper wires
+ An additional passive tone buzzer for stereo sound

**Play me a tune (using a drop switch)**
A drop switch has been crafted using two pieces of foil with foil also attached to the bottom of a character. When the character is dropped on the switch, the tune activates.

**Sound Bomb (inverted party popper switch + annoying SFX cycle)**
Based on the previous Party popper project: when the piece of cardboard is pulled, it allows a spring loaded switch (a clothes peg with tin foil) to close and then plays an endless loop of annoying sounds and accompanying coloured lights.
