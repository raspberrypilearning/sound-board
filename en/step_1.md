## Introduction

Create a sound machine that will play sound effects or music using buttons, switches or a potentiometer.

<span style="color: #0faeb0">**Add**</span> a suitable boxout here.
</p>

You will:

+ Design a device that uses sound for a specific purpose
+ Program music or sounds effects to play on a buzzer
+ Create an interface that allows user control of sounds

To complete this project you will need:

+ A Raspberry Pi Pico with pin headers soldered on
+ A data USB A to micro USB cable
+ A potentiometer or buttons (bought or crafted)
+ A passive tone buzzer 
+ Jumper wires
+ Craft materials including card, sticky tape and kitchen foil

Optional:

+ RGB LED(s) or single colour LED(s) with resistors and jumper wires
+ An additional passive tone buzzer for stereo sound
