**Think:** Some questions to consider in the design of the casing and interface for your sound machine: 

+ What materials will you use? What do you have available?
+ If you are crafting buttons or switches, what kind will you make? How will they operate?
+ How will you mount your controls so they are sturdy and easy to reach?

**Tip:** Make sure that your code is **saved** and that your Thonny console is minimised. This will help to avoid you accidentally tapping your keyboard and editing your code whilst you make your sound machine.

**Find** the materials you will use to create the physical parts of your sound machine.

You could use:
+ Cardboard boxes
+ Recycled plastic items
+ Old toys
+ LEGO
+ Duct tape
+ Hot glue (ask an adult!)
+ Scissors (ask an adult!)
+ Craft knife (ask an adult!)
+ 3D printer (if you're very lucky!)

If you have chosen to craft buttons or switches, now is the time to make them. 

There are lots of different ways to craft buttons and switches that you can connect to the Raspberry Pi Pico. 

You need to use conductive material such as kitchen foil and make a connection between a **GND** pin and a **GP** pin. The Raspberry Pi Pico will be able to read whether GND and the GP pin are connected.

Here are some examples:

Be careful if you are using any sharp or hot tools and get adult permission and supervision before you start!

Make a note of which pins have been used for each component. This will help you connect your wires back onto your Raspberry Pi Pico. 

**Tip**: The pins are listed at the top of your code.

Assemble your sound machine. Try not to permanently glue your enclosure together as you might want replace wires or components at a later date. 

**Tip:** Use sticky tape to secure your wires as your wiring might come loose whilst you assemble your sound machine.

**Test:** your sound machine. Now that it has been assembled, check that your components still work as intended.

**Debug:** 

Your code was working before you assembled your sound machine. It is unlikely that your code will be broken at this stage. The majority of bugs will be from wiring and components.

Now that you have crafted your sound machine, you might need extra-long wires to attach your component to your Raspberry Pi pins. Look at the instructions above to 'join jumper wires to extend them'.

Some connections are stronger than others so you might find that you need to use tape to keep your wires connected to your components or to hold your components in place on your machine. Look at the instructions above to 'secure wires and components using tape'.
