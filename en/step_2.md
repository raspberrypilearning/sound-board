## Design your sound machine

<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap">
<div style="flex-basis: 200px; flex-grow: 1; margin-right: 15px;">
What is the purpose of your sounds machine? How will the user use inputs to control the sounds that are made?

**Choose:** Decide on the purpose of your sound machine. Who is it for and how will it be used? 

Your sound machine could be:

+ An instrument
+ A musical player
+ A sound effects creator
+ A machine that makes you feel calm
+ A machine designed to annoy others with silly noises

**Choose:** What sounds will your sound machine play?

+ Single musical notes for an instrument
+ Whole songs or tunes
+ Sound effects such as thunder or a bird chirping 
+ Use a variable input from a potentiometer to control pitch or the speed of a beat

### How many components can you have?

The Raspberry Pi Pico has eight **GND** pins so when you are using jumper wires, you can only have eight components unless some share a **GND** pin.

Each speaker can ony play one note at a time so you will need multiple speakers if you want to play multiple sounds at the same time. 

There is only one **3V** pin so you can only use one potentiometer. There is also a limit to how much current the Raspberry Pi Pico can supply. 

Suggested combinations of input and outputs are:
+ 1 potentiometer and 1 buzzer 
+ 4 buttons and buzzer
+ 8 crafted buttons and a buzzer
+ 1 potentiometer, 2 buttons and two buzzers
+ Multiple buttons and a matching number of buzzers to play chords (multiple notes at the same time)

**Choose:** How many buttons and buzzers will your design use?

It could have:
+ One buzzer
+ Two buzzer to create stereo sound or a beat plus a note
+ Earphones - you will also need three crocodile/alligator clip leads to connect to them
+ Multiple buzzers if you have them

Will you also use LEDs?

As an optional extra, you may wish to use a single coloured LED or an RGB LED. You will need to make sure that there are enough pins on your Raspberry Pi Pico for an LED if this is something that you would like to add.

**Choose:** What input components will you use for your device?

You could use any combination of:

+ One or more buttons
+ A potentiometer (you can control the pitch of the buzzer with the potentiometer, or the speed of a regular beat)
+ Crafted buttons/switches that make a connection

**Design:** Decide on the overall look of your device. What will your sound machine look like? How will you attach your inputs and outputs?

Will you:

+ Base your design on a traditional instrument such as a piano
+ Draw a picture or make a scene with buttons to trigger relevant sounds
+ Craft switches or buttons
+ Use craft materials to make an enclosure

**Tip:** You don't need to decide everything now. It's fine to iterate on your design as you start making.
