## Design your sound machine

What is the purpose of your sounds machine? How will the user use inputs to control the sounds that are made?

**Choose:** Decide on the purpose of your sound machine. Who is it for and how will it be used?

+ Is it an instrument?
+ Is it a musical player?
+ Is it a sound effects creator?
+ Is it designed to trigger an emotion? Calm or annoying!


--- /task ---

**Choose:** What sounds will your sound machine play?

+ Single musical notes for an instrument
+ Whole songs or tunes
+ Sound effects such as thunder or a bird chirping 
+ Use a variable input from a potentiometer to control pitch or the speed of a beat

The Raspberry Pi Pico has eight **GND** pins so when you are using jumper wires, you can only have eight components. We have included instructions for sharing a GND pin so you can create a full octave of 8 notes and have a GND for a speaker.

Each speaker can ony play one note at a time so you will need multiple speakers if you want to play multiple sounds at the same time. 

There is only one **3V** pin so you can only use one potentiometer. There is also a limit to how much current the Raspberry Pi Pico can supply. 

Suggested combinations of input and outputs are:
+ 1 potentiometer and 1 buzzer 
+ 4 buttons and buzzer
+ 8 crafted buttons and a buzzer
+ 1 potentiometer, 2 buttons and two buzzers
+ Multiple buttons and a matching number of buzzers to play chords (multiple notes at the same time)

--- task ---

**Choose:** How many buttons and buzzers will your design use. 

You could use:
+ One buzzer
+ Two buzzer to create stereo sound or a beat plus a note
+ Earphones - you will also need three crocodile/alligator clip leads to connect to them
+ Multiple buzzers if you have them

Will you also use LEDs?

**Choose:** What input components will you use for your device?

You could use any combination of:

+ One or more buttons
+ A potentiometer (you can control the pitch of the buzzer with the potentiometer, or the speed of a regular beat)
+ Crafted buttons/switches that make a connection

**Design:** Decide on the overall look of your device. What will your sound machine look like? How will you attach your inputs and outputs?

Will you:

+ Base your design on a traditional instrument such as a piano,
+ Draw a picture or make a scene with buttons to trigger relevant sounds,
+ Craft switches or buttons,
+ Use craft materials to make an enclosure?


**Tip:** You don't need to decide everything now. It's fine to iterate on your design as you start making.
