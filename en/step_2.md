**Choose:** Decide on the purpose of your sound machine. Who is it for and how will it be used? 

Your sound machine could be:

+ An instrument
+ A musical player
+ A sound effects creator
+ A machine that makes you feel calm
+ A machine designed to annoy others with silly noises

**Choose:** What sounds will your sound machine play?

+ Single musical notes for an instrument
+ Whole songs or tunes
+ Sound effects such as thunder or a bird chirping 
+ Use a variable input from a potentiometer to control pitch or the speed of a beat

--- /task ---

### How many components can you have?

[[[pico-limitations]]]

Suggested combinations of input and outputs are:
+ 1 potentiometer and 1 buzzer 
+ 4 buttons and buzzer
+ 8 crafted buttons and a buzzer
+ 1 potentiometer, 2 buttons and two buzzers
+ Multiple buttons and a matching number of buzzers to play chords (multiple notes at the same time)

**Choose:** How many buttons and buzzers will your design use?

It could have:
+ One buzzer
+ Two buzzer to create stereo sound or a beat plus a note
+ Earphones - you will also need three crocodile/alligator clip leads to connect to them
+ Multiple buzzers if you have them

**Choose:** What input components will you use for your device?

You could use any combination of:
+ One or more buttons
+ A potentiometer (you can control the pitch of the buzzer with the potentiometer, or the speed of a regular beat)
+ Crafted buttons/switches that make a connection

**Design:** Decide on the overall look of your device. What will your sound machine look like? How will you attach your inputs and outputs?

Will you:

+ Base your design on a traditional instrument such as a piano
+ Draw a picture or make a scene with buttons to trigger relevant sounds
+ Craft switches or buttons
+ Use craft materials to make an enclosure

**Tip:** You don't need to decide everything now. It's fine to iterate on your design as you start making.
